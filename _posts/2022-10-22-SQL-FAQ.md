In this blog, we will discuss several encountered tasks using SQL and different ways to tackle it.

### 1. Remove duplicated records.
Here is a question from Leetcode for beginner SQL:

{:class="table table-bordered"}
| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| id          | int      |
| email       | varchar  |


* id is the primary key column for this table called Person.
* Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
* Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

There are several ways to tackle the question.
#### 1. Use DELETE Statement

```SQL
DELETE p1 FROM   
Person AS p1, Person AS p2  
WHERE p1.email = p2.email and p1.id > p2.id  
```

#### 2. Use SELECT Statement

```SQL
SELECT MIN(id) AS id, email 
FROM Person 
GROUP BY email
```
#### 3. Use Window Function
```SQL
SELECT id, email
FROM(
  SELECT id, email, 
  RANK() OVER ( PARTITION BY email ORDER BY id) AS row_number FROM Person
) AS a
WHERE row_number = 1
```
